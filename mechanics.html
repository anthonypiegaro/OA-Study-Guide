                <strong>Pitching mechanics</strong> are a set of movements unique to individual athletes that 
                reflects their intentions as they throw a baseball to a target.
              </p>
              <p>
                Please note that the following checkpoints and phases do not accurately reflect what is
                actually occuring in the delivery. They are a way to standardize specifics moments in time of the 
                pitching delivery.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Checkpoints:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>Balance Point (BAL)<br />- Moment of Peak Leg Lift</li>
                  <li>Stride-Foot Contact (SFC)<br />- Moment when lead leg foot is flush with the ground and lead leg begins to brace</li>
                  <li>Maximum Shoulder External Rotation (MER)<br />- Moment when the throwing forearm is maximumlly laid back</li>
                  <li>Ball Release (REL)<br />- Moment when the ball exits the hand</li>
                  <li>Maximum Shoulder Internal Rotation (MIR)<br />- Moment when the throwing arm has stopped internally rotating and tilting of the scapula has completed</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Phases:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>Windup Phase<br />- All movement prior to the lead leg descending from max leg lift</li>
                  <li>Stride Phase<br />- Begins as lead leg descends from max leg lift. Ends when lead leg contacts the ground</li>
                  <li>Arm Cocking Phase (Late Cocking Phase)<br />- Begins when the torso begins to rotate and the internial mass of the baseballlays the pitching forearm backwards into external rotation and scapular tilt. Ends when the arm begins to accelerate forward</li>
                  <li>Arm Acceleration Phase<br />- Begins when baseball stops moving backwards and begins to accelerate out of maximally laid-back position of the throwing arm</li>
                  <li>Arm Deceleration Phase<br />- Begins after ball release as the pitching arm slows down to a stop</li>
                  <li>Follow Through Phase<br />- Begins at the end of the Deceleration phase, as the thrower's residual linear and rotational movement carries into the final position</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                Another quick note regarding the previous checkpoints and phases: These "positions" are not meant to be mimicked. When using these, think of them as tools
                to help aid the athlete in trying to improve their movements. Do not try to box athletes into these positions, as they are a guide to help standardise time
                in the pitching delivery, not a standard for perfect mechanics.
              </p>
              <p>
                <p><strong>Method for Training Mechanics</strong></p>
                <p>A quick note on internal and external cues:
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Internal cue:</strong> Athlete has a primary focus on the movement</li>
                    <li><strong>External cue:</strong> Athlete has a primary focus on the effect of the movement</li>
                  </ul>
                  Athletes produce more force and sequence more efficiently when they focus externally instead of internally. Thus, try to limit the amount of internal cueing.
                  This may also help prevent the athlete from over thinking. You want to make the athlete as comfortable and smooth as possible for the greatest adaptations in the 
                  throwing movement.
                </p>
                <p>Training Protocol:</p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Backwards Chaining:</strong> Method of teaching and learning that starts with the final step or goal and works backwardsto the initial steps. It is
                  commonly used in skill acquisition and task completion scenerios, aiming to break down complex tasks into smaller, more managable components
                </p>
                <p>Implementation Strategy:</p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Chunking Process:</strong> All movements are integrated into a station-based approach with varied resistances.
                </p>
                <p>Evaluation Method:</p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Test-Retest Method:</strong> Evaluate improvements in an iterative fashion, allowing an appropriate amount of time in between tests for the spefic adaptation being trained for.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>A last note in regards to teaching mechanics:</strong> The following is a guide, not a cookie-cutter model. The athlete's results should always matter more than aesthetics.

                          <strong>Arm Action</strong> describes the throwing arm's movement as the ball seperates from the glove and takes a 
                          particular path to eventually get the forearm in a somewhat vertical position.
                          <p>
                            The three primary tasks of arm action:
                            <ul>
                              <li>
                                Elbow movement at the end of Seperation Phase and through the Pickup Phase retracts the throwing
                                side scap. This helps resist early trunk rotation, which in turn helps the athlete
                                maintain trunk stack and engage the muscles around the scapula to create the "scap load" on the
                                throwing side.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                Throwing hand is somewhat nuetral when the forearm becomes vertical around the time of stride-foot contact.
                                Neutral in this context means the palm is facing the same direction as the chest.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                The elbow makes somewhat of an upward move (Elbow-Sprial Phase) to lead the arm into external rotation (Driveline Phase).
                                This creates the best chance to minimize early elbow extension.
                              </li>
                            </ul>
                            Arm action evaluation should depend of movement quality and not positions. If the arm action
                            accomplishes the three tasks, you have a good arm action.

                            <strong>Seperation Phase</strong> begins when the throwing hand seperates from the glove  and ends when the Pickup Phase begins.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            <strong>Timing</strong> of the seperation of hand with the glove depends on the tempo of the delivery.
                            High tempo throwers will seperate earlier relative to slow tempo throwers, who will seperate their hands later in the 
                            delivery.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            <strong>Forearm positioning </strong> is an important variable in the seperation phase, as it sets up the arm for the proceeding movements.
                            The forearm should be slightly supinated to neutral when seperating. If the arm flyies more towards second base, then pronation will be required
                            to keep the arm connected to the body.
                          </p>
                          <p>The purpose of the seperation phase is to get the throwing arm in a good position to transition into the Pickup Phase, 
                            accomplisheed by proper timing of the seperation and proper forearm supination/pronation.

                            <strong>Pickup Phase </strong>begins when the forearm and wrist start moveing skyward after the Seperation Phase
                            has ended. This phase ends as Elbow-Spiral Phase begins, partially overlapping with the Disconnection Phase.

                          <p>
                            <strong>Two primary</strong> ways that initiate the Pickup Phase:
                            <ol>
                              <li>
                                Throwing-arm pickup movement is dominated by the elbow's retracting the throwing side scap.
                                <ul>
                                  <li>As the throwing hand seperates from the glove in a slightly supinated-to-neutral position,
                                    the elbow begins to move in a posterior direction, long enough to keep the trunk closed as
                                    the lower half rotates and the glove arm disconnects, but the elbow's height never climbs above
                                    the shoulder
                                  </li>
                                </ul>
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                Throwing-arm pickup movement is dominated by taking the hand and forearm moving towards 2nd base.
                                <ul>
                                  <li>
                                    Athletes will have a pronated takeaway and take the ball towards second base, but begin
                                    to move the elbow posteriorly while supinating the forearm, ultimately neutralizing the throwing hand around
                                    stride-foot contact.
                                  </li>
                                </ul>
                              </li>
                            </ol>
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            By the end of the Pickup Phase, the athlete should have:
                            <ul>
                              <li>
                                had the arm move slightly upwards, having elbow height stabilize around shoulder height 
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                the shoulder begin to externally rotate to raise forearm in a somewhat vertical position,
                                with the palm in a neutral position, right around stride-foot contact.
                              </li>
                            </ul>

                          <p>
                            If the athlete has done the following movements efficiently, they will be in a good position to transition
                            into the Elbow-Sprial Phase.

                            <strong>Disconnection Phase</strong> begins around the middle of the Pickup Phase and ends when the Driveline Phase begins.

                            <strong>Positive disconnection</strong> is the term for utilizing teh glove arm to retract the lead scap in unison with the 
                            scap retraction occuring on the throwing-arm side, creating thoracic-spine extension ("
                            big chest")
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            <strong>Order of events</strong> the glove arm should go through:
                            <ol>
                              <li>
                                As the throwing hand seperates from the glove, the glove arm reaches towards the vicinity of the target, usually a bit
                                on the chest side of the target. Often, the glove hand is in a pronated position, but some athletes keep the hand supinated.
                                The glove arm isn't too closed off.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                Towards the end of teh Stride Phase and during the middle of the Pickup Phase, the glove-arm elobow begins to move on a path 
                                towards the back of the hip, and the glove hand simultaneuosly supinates. Note that if the glove-hand remains pronated as the elbow moves,
                                it might lead to the lead shoulder puuling open too ealry. As this is occuring, the athlete should keep the lead shoulder cloased 
                                as long as possible until tey must rotate to throw the ball.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                Once the end range of motion has been reached with the glove arm, the shoulders should continue to rotate and the forearm should be about parallel with 
                                the ground, with the glove somewhere close to underneath the armpit.
                              </li>
                            </ol>

                          <p>
                            Elite positive disconnection increases linear-force production, allowing athletes to increase the speed in which their
                            trunks rotate.
