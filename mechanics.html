                <strong>Pitching mechanics</strong> are a set of movements unique to individual athletes that 
                reflects their intentions as they throw a baseball to a target.
              </p>
              <p>
                Please note that the following checkpoints and phases do not accurately reflect what is
                actually occuring in the delivery. They are a way to standardize specifics moments in time of the 
                pitching delivery.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Checkpoints:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>Balance Point (BAL)<br />- Moment of Peak Leg Lift</li>
                  <li>Stride-Foot Contact (SFC)<br />- Moment when lead leg foot is flush with the ground and lead leg begins to brace</li>
                  <li>Maximum Shoulder External Rotation (MER)<br />- Moment when the throwing forearm is maximumlly laid back</li>
                  <li>Ball Release (REL)<br />- Moment when the ball exits the hand</li>
                  <li>Maximum Shoulder Internal Rotation (MIR)<br />- Moment when the throwing arm has stopped internally rotating and tilting of the scapula has completed</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Phases:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>Windup Phase<br />- All movement prior to the lead leg descending from max leg lift</li>
                  <li>Stride Phase<br />- Begins as lead leg descends from max leg lift. Ends when lead leg contacts the ground</li>
                  <li>Arm Cocking Phase (Late Cocking Phase)<br />- Begins when the torso begins to rotate and the internial mass of the baseballlays the pitching forearm backwards into external rotation and scapular tilt. Ends when the arm begins to accelerate forward</li>
                  <li>Arm Acceleration Phase<br />- Begins when baseball stops moving backwards and begins to accelerate out of maximally laid-back position of the throwing arm</li>
                  <li>Arm Deceleration Phase<br />- Begins after ball release as the pitching arm slows down to a stop</li>
                  <li>Follow Through Phase<br />- Begins at the end of the Deceleration phase, as the thrower's residual linear and rotational movement carries into the final position</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                Another quick note regarding the previous checkpoints and phases: These "positions" are not meant to be mimicked. When using these, think of them as tools
                to help aid the athlete in trying to improve their movements. Do not try to box athletes into these positions, as they are a guide to help standardise time
                in the pitching delivery, not a standard for perfect mechanics.
              </p>
              <p>
                <p><strong>Method for Training Mechanics</strong></p>
                <p>A quick note on internal and external cues:
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Internal cue:</strong> Athlete has a primary focus on the movement</li>
                    <li><strong>External cue:</strong> Athlete has a primary focus on the effect of the movement</li>
                  </ul>
                  Athletes produce more force and sequence more efficiently when they focus externally instead of internally. Thus, try to limit the amount of internal cueing.
                  This may also help prevent the athlete from over thinking. You want to make the athlete as comfortable and smooth as possible for the greatest adaptations in the 
                  throwing movement.
                </p>
                <p>Training Protocol:</p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Backwards Chaining:</strong> Method of teaching and learning that starts with the final step or goal and works backwardsto the initial steps. It is
                  commonly used in skill acquisition and task completion scenerios, aiming to break down complex tasks into smaller, more managable components
                </p>
                <p>Implementation Strategy:</p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Chunking Process:</strong> All movements are integrated into a station-based approach with varied resistances.
                </p>
                <p>Evaluation Method:</p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Test-Retest Method:</strong> Evaluate improvements in an iterative fashion, allowing an appropriate amount of time in between tests for the spefic adaptation being trained for.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>A last note in regards to teaching mechanics:</strong> The following is a guide, not a cookie-cutter model. The athlete's results should always matter more than aesthetics.

                          <strong>Arm Action</strong> describes the throwing arm's movement as the ball seperates from the glove and takes a 
                          particular path to eventually get the forearm in a somewhat vertical position.
                          <p>
                            The three primary tasks of arm action:
                            <ul>
                              <li>
                                Elbow movement at the end of Seperation Phase and through the Pickup Phase retracts the throwing
                                side scap. This helps resist early trunk rotation, which in turn helps the athlete
                                maintain trunk stack and engage the muscles around the scapula to create the "scap load" on the
                                throwing side.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                Throwing hand is nuetral when the forearm becomes vertical around teh time of stride-foot contact.
                                
                              </li>
